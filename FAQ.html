        <h2 class="title is-3">What is COVID-19?</h2>
        <h3>
          COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults
          and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or
          lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more
          serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
        </h3>
        <h2 class="title is-3">How does it spread?</h2>
        <h3>
          It is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through
          respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or
          sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who
          are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more
          likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about
          6 feet). It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching
          a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their
          own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the
          main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this
          virus. The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and
          sustainably between people. Information from the ongoing COVID-19
          pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more efficiently than
          influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly
          contagious.

        <h2 class="title is-3">How to prevent COVID-19</h2>
        <h3>
          The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this
          virus.
        </h3>
        <h3>
          To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, everyone should: Clean your
          hands often, either with soap and water for 20 seconds or a hand
          sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid close contact with
          people who are sick. Put distance between yourself and other people
          (at least 6 feet). Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover
          when around others. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then
          throw the tissue in the trash. Clean and disinfect frequently touched
          objects and surfaces daily.
