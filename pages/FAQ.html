    <h1>Coronavirus FAQ</h1>
    <h2>What is COVID-19?</h2>
    <h3>
      COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and
      people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung
      disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious
      complications from COVID-19 illness.
    </h3>
    <h2>How does it spread?</h2>
    <h3>
      It is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through
      respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
      These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or
      possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are
      in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). It may be
      possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object
      that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
      possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus
      spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus. The virus that
      causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people.
      Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is
      spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as
      measles, which is highly contagious.
