            The world is facing an unprecedented challenge with communities and
            economies everywhere affected by the growing COVID-19 pandemic. The
            world is coming together to combat the COVID-19 pandemic bringing
            governments, organizations from across industries and sectors and
            individuals together to help respond to this global outbreak. The
            outpouring of global solidarity and support sparked by this shared
            challenge has been phenomenal.

            outlines a funding need of at least US$675 million for critical
            response efforts in countries most in need of help through April
            2020. As this outbreak evolves, funding needs are likely to
            increase.
